Before we get started, I've got a little bit of housekeeping to go over.

This is our last week of regular class. The next two weeks (weeks 12 and 13) are
dedicated time to work on your course project. 

I'll still be in Bray 300 during class time if you have questions or want help
with your project, and I'll still be holding my regular office hours. That said,
if you don't think coming to class will be a productive way for you to spend 
your time, that's totally fine.

Three weeks from now (week 14, our last day of class) everyone will share their
final presentation on the project. You should hand in all your files
(report and code) by the start of that class.

---

Your final presentation should be about five minutes (or less). Ideally you'll
talk about the problem you wanted to solve, the methods you used, and how well
it went. You can use slides if you want, or you can feel free to just talk about
your project for five minutes.

The presentations are meant as an opportunity for us to find out what everyone
else has been working on; they should not be a high-stakes event.
