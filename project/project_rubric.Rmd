# Grading

+ Introduction
  - Explain background
  - Clearly state objective
+ Methods
  - Explain data set
  - Necessary pre-processing was justified and performed (ie encoding categorical variables, ) (TK points)
  - Appropriately used at least one "simple" model (linear/logistic regression, decision tree, KNN) (5 points)
  - Appropriately used at least two "complex" models (random forest, GBM, SVM, ensembling methods) (5 points each, max 15)
  - Report is reproducible:
    - Sets a seed (5 points)
    - Code runs _immediately_ on my machine (no hard-coded file paths, no bugs, no `setwd()`) (30 points)
+ Results
  - Multiple accuracy metrics are reported appropriately (i.e., using a hold-out set) (5 points)
+ Discussion
  - Discussion of model implications (areas of more/less accuracy)
  - Discussion of what could have been done better
+ Presentation
  - Presentation included objectives, methods, results, and reflection (5 points each)
  
  
Grades are assigned as follows:

< 70 points: F
70-80 points: C
80-90 points: B
\> 90 points: A
