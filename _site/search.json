While statistics – with an emphasis on data models, estimation, and hypothesis testing – has traditionally focused on explaining relationships between system inputs and outcomes, the modern world has given rise to a new class of algorithms which predict outcomes without any concept of causality or underlying data models at all.\nThese pure prediction algorithms, broadly referred to as “machine learning algorithms”, have been embraced across domains, with massive success and public interest to match. But this success comes at the cost of complexity, and implementing these techniques requires different techniques and a different mindset than traditional data model based approaches.\nThis course attempts to help with the transition, guiding students through several of the most common machine learning approaches with a focus on application. Each week, students are expected to read a course handout on the concepts and applications of a particular machine learning algorithm. Weekly classes will then focus on clarifying and expanding upon the reading, with weekly assignments designed to give students hands-on experience implementing and tuning these different approaches on both example data and a real-world data set of their choice. Topics include the random forest, gradient boosting machine, and support vector machine algorithms as well as cross validation, loss functions, regularization, and model averaging.\nPrerequisites\nStudents must have some familiarity with the R language, including defining functions, managing objects, controlling the flow of a program (e.g. if/else statements and for-loops), wrangling data in data frames, fitting linear models (i.e., the lm function) and other basic tasks.\nAn introductory stats course (APM391 or equivalent) is recommended.\nCalendar\n\n\nWeek\n\n\nTopic\n\n\nPackages\n\n\nAssignment\n\n\n1\n\n\nPrediction, Estimation, and Attribution\n\n\nNone\n\n\nAssignment 1\n\n\n2\n\n\nRegression\n\n\nNone\n\n\nAssignment 2\n\n\n3\n\n\nClassification\n\n\npROC\n\n\nAssignment 3\n\n\n4\n\n\nDecision Trees\n\n\nrpart\n\n\nNone\n\n\n5\n\n\nRandom Forests\n\n\nranger\n\n\nAssignment 4\n\n\n6\n\n\nHyperparameters and Model Tuning\n\n\nranger, purrr\n\n\nAssignment 5\n\n\n7\n\n\nGradient Boosting Machines\n\n\ngbm\n\n\nAssignment 6\n\n\n8\n\n\nStochastic GBMs\n\n\nlightGBM\n\n\nAssignment 7\n\n\n9\n\n\nLoss Functions and Regularization\n\n\nlightGBM\n\n\nAssignment 8\n\n\n10\n\n\nSupport Vector Machines\n\n\nkernlab\n\n\nAssignment 9\n\n\n11\n\n\nImplementing SVMs\n\n\nkernlab\n\n\nAssignment 10\n\n\n12\n\n\nModel Averaging\n\n\nNone\n\n\nAssignment 11\n\n\n13\n\n\nFinal Topics\n\n\nNone\n\n\nNone\n\n\nTextbooks\nThis class draws heavily from materials presented in the following two books. Both books are freely available online and you do not need to purchase a physical copy of either book to succeed in this class; there are no assigned readings from these books.\nBradley Boehmke and Brandon Greenwell.

Cambridge University Press. Available online at https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI_files/PDF/casi.pdf .\nMaterial Requirements\nThis course focuses on learning through doing, and as such requires students have access to a computer they are able to install software packages on. All other materials and texts are available for free online.\n\n\n\n",
