Whether it’s predicting how species will adapt to a changing climate, which plant cultivars will hold their own against non-native diseases, or what pair of pants a customer is most likely to buy, prediction – and the algorithms built to predict – have come to dominate how we work and live in an incredibly short span of time. These predictive methods have seen their popularity skyrocket throughout the sciences in recent years, as it becomes increasingly important to not just understand how systems work but to communicate how they might respond to human activity moving forward.\nThe algorithms developed to enable all this prediction – referred to as “pure prediction algorithms” or, more loosely, “machine learning” – have seen massive success across domains. But this success comes at the cost of complexity, and implementing these techniques requires new tools and a different mindset than traditional statistical modeling as taught to most professionals.\nThis course attempts to help bridge that gap, guiding students through several of the most common machine learning approaches at a conceptual level with a focus on applications in R. Topics include the random forest and gradient boosting machine algorithms as well as cross validation and loss functions.\nCourse Structure\nEach week students are expected to read a handout on the concepts and applications of a particular machine learning algorithm. Weekly assignments are then designed to walk students through applying these concepts to real prediction problems, easing students into writing their own machine learning code.\nWeekly classes are a one-hour mix of lecture and discussion, designed to support and expand upon the concepts of that week’s assignment and allow students to clarify their understanding of the topics at hand.\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to:\nImplement common supervised learning algorithms in R to make predictions against well-formed data sets.\nUse accepted hyperparameter tuning approaches to improve model fits across multiple algorithms.\nExplain how to assess predictive models, both throughout the iteration process and as a final product.\nPrerequisites\nStudents must have some familiarity with the R language, including defining functions, managing objects, controlling the flow of a program (e.g. if/else statements and for-loops), wrangling data in data frames, fitting linear models (i.e., the lm function) and other basic tasks.\nAn introductory stats course is recommended.\nTextbooks and Materials\nThis class draws heavily from materials presented in the following two books. Both books are freely available online and you do not need to purchase a physical copy of either book to succeed in this class; there are no assigned readings from these books.\nBradley Boehmke and Brandon Greenwell. (2020). Hands on Machine Learning with R. CRC Press. Available online at https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/ .\nBradley Efron and Trevor Hastie. (2016). Computer Age Statistical Inference. Cambridge University Press. Available online at https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI_files/PDF/casi.pdf .\nStudents will need to have access to a computer they are able to install R packages on.\nGrading\nMost weeks, students will be given a hands-on programming assignment due the following class. Grades are based solely on assignment performance. Each assignment is worth an equal number of points.\nStudents with Learning and Physical Disabilities\nSUNY-ESF works with the Office of Disability Services (ODS) at Syracuse University, who is responsible for coordinating disability-related accommodations. Students can contact ODS at 804 University Avenue- Room 309, 315-443-4498 to schedule an appointment and discuss their needs and the process for requesting accommodations. Students may also contact the ESF Office of Student Affairs, 110 Bray Hall, 315-470-6660 for assistance with the process. To learn more about ODS, visit http://disabilityservices.syr.edu. Students who attempt to use accommodations without advance notice to faculty will be referred to the ESF Office of the Dean for Student Affairs. Since accommodations may require early planning and generally are not provided retroactively, please contact ODS as soon as possible.\nAcademic Dishonesty\nAcademic dishonesty is a breach of trust between a student, one’s fellow students, or the instructor(s). By registering for courses at ESF you acknowledge your awareness of the ESF Code of Student Conduct (http://www.esf.edu/students/handbook/StudentHB.05.pdf ), in particular academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to plagiarism and cheating, and other forms of academic misconduct. The Academic Integrity Handbook contains further information and guidance (http://www.esf.edu/students/integrity/). Infractions of the academic integrity code may lead to academic penalties as per the ESF Grading Policy (http://www.esf.edu/provost/policies/documents/GradingPolicy.11.12.2013.pdf).\nInclusive Excellence Statement\nAs an institution, we embrace inclusive excellence and the strengths of a diverse and inclusive community. During classroom discussions, we may be challenged by ideas different from our lived experiences and cultures. Understanding individual differences and broader social differences will deepen our understanding of each other and the world around us. In this course, all people (including but not limited to, people of all races, ethnicities, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and expression, students undergoing transition, religions, ages, abilities, socioeconomic backgrounds, veteran status, regions and nationalities, intellectual perspectives and political persuasion) are strongly encouraged to respectfully share their unique perspectives and experiences. This statement is intended to help cultivate a respectful environment, and it should not be used in a way that limits expression or restricts academic freedom at ESF.\n\n\n\n",
