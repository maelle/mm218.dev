# Stochastic GBMs

---
class: middle




We ended last week's discussion of GBMs by talking about how GBMs can be 
incredibly effective prediction algorithms, but at the cost of being 
computationally intensive to fit and less adept at reducing variance error than
random forests.

This week, we'll focus on extensions to the basic GBM which help address that.

---
class: middle

Last week, I briefly mentioned that the `gbm` package fits each of its trees on 
a different random subsample of the training data each time. 

This algorithm is more properly known as **stochastic gradient boosting machines**, 
as the data each tree is fit to will change every time you re-run the model
(assuming you haven't set a seed).

This simple change improves GBM accuracy enough that I'm not actually aware of
a GBM implementation that doesn't resample.

But this left researchers wondering -- could other forms of randomness, like
we use in random forests, improve GBMs even further?

---
class: middle

Remember that random forests use two main forms of randomness to increase the
variance between their decision trees.

First off, each tree is fit to a different bootstrap sample; rather than 
subsampling the training data, random forests fit decision trees to data with 
the same number of observations as the training data, sampled with replacement.

Secondly, each split in each decision tree is selected from a different 
subsample of predictors. 

What if we introduced these forms of randomness to GBMs?

---
class: middle

There's currently a lot of competition between packages for fitting these sorts
of stochastic GBMs. There are three main contenders worth mentioning briefly:

+ `xgboost`, released in 2014, was the first mainstream stochastic GBM 
  implementation to really take off and is still very popular today.
  
+ `lightGBM`, released in 2016, runs dramatically faster than `xgboost` while
  still producing highly accurate models.
  
+ `catboost`, released in 2019, is slower and less accurate than `lightGBM` but 
  makes it a bit easier to deal with categorical variables.

We're going to use `lightGBM`, because I like it the most. Go ahead and install it
now:


```r
install.packages(
  "lightgbm", 
  repos = "https://cran.microsoft.com/snapshot/2021-10-24/")
```

---

Before we actually fit a model, however, we need to prepare our data. We'll use
the Ames housing data set today:


```r
ames &lt;- AmesHousing::make_ames()
```

Before we split this into testing and training sets, however, we first need to 
encode our categorical variables. `lightGBM` (as well as `xgboost`) can't handle
categorical variables directly, so we'll need to one-hot encode them first.

Way back in Week 2 we talked about how to do this with `dplyr` and `tidyr`:


```r
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
ames %&gt;% 
  mutate(dummy_value = 1) %&gt;% # Create a dummy value column
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = Foundation,
    names_prefix = "Foundation", 
    values_from = dummy_value, 
    values_fill = 0 
    ) %&gt;% 
  select(starts_with("Foundation"), Sale_Price, Year_Built, Gr_Liv_Area) |&gt; 
  head(1)
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 9
##   FoundationCBlock FoundationPConc FoundationWood FoundationBrkTil
##              &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1                1               0              0                0
## # … with 5 more variables: FoundationSlab &lt;dbl&gt;, FoundationStone &lt;dbl&gt;,
## #   Sale_Price &lt;int&gt;, Year_Built &lt;int&gt;, Gr_Liv_Area &lt;int&gt;
```


---
class: middle

However, the Ames data has 46 categorical variables to encode, so doing them
one-at-a-time is going to take a while.

Instead, we're going to use a new package named `recipes` to dummy encode all of 
our variables at once. Let's install it now:


```r
install.packages("recipes")
```

---

The `recipes` package is a fantastic tool that helps us pre-process our data 
before we fit our models. In order to use it to encode our variables, we need
to walk through a few steps.

First off, we'll load the package:


```r
library(recipes)
```

Then we'll create a "recipe" object, which tells the other functions from the
package what formula and data we're trying to work with:


```r
ames_recipe &lt;- recipe(Sale_Price ~ ., data = ames)
```

We're now able to specify what pre-processing steps we want to take using any 
number of functions from `recipes`, all using the `step_` prefix.

For example, to say that we want to dummy encode all
the factors in our data, we can use the `step_dummy` function:


```r
ames_recipe &lt;- step_dummy(ames_recipe, where(is.factor))
```

---

If we wanted, we could keep adding pre-processing steps to our "recipe" object.
Since we just want to encode our factors, we'll tell the `recipes` package we're
done by using the `prep` function:


```r
ames_recipe &lt;- prep(ames_recipe) 
```

And finally, we'll actually encode our variables by way of the `bake` function:


```r
ames &lt;- bake(ames_recipe, ames)
```

With that all done, we've finally got a data frame with encoded categorical 
variables:


```r
head(ames[36:309])
```

```

---

I should point out that the `recipes` package is really designed to work with
the pipe operator. 

While the process of dummy encoding our variables seems
like a lot when broken into separate lines, like I just did for explanation,
the code is a lot neater when piped together:


```r
ames &lt;- AmesHousing::make_ames()
ames &lt;- recipe(Sale_Price ~ ., data = ames) |&gt; 
  step_dummy(where(is.factor)) |&gt; 
  prep() |&gt; 
  bake(ames)
head(ames[36:309])
```

```

We'll talk a little bit more about using `recipes` for data processing next week.

For now, once our variables are encoded, we'll go ahead and split our data into 
training and testing sets:


```r
set.seed(123)

row_idx &lt;- sample(seq_len(nrow(ames)), nrow(ames))
training &lt;- ames[row_idx &lt; nrow(ames) * 0.8, ]
testing &lt;- ames[row_idx &gt;= nrow(ames) * 0.8, ]
```

And load lightgbm:


```r
library(lightgbm)
```

If you look at `?lightgbm`, you'll notice that it looks a little bit different
than `?lm` or the other models we've worked with so far. 

Specifically, 
`lightgbm` doesn't have a `formula` argument for us to use to specify our model.

---

Instead, we need to provide `lightgbm` with a _matrix_ of our predictors and a
_vector_ of our outcome.

We can create those objects like this:


```r
xtrain &lt;- as.matrix(training[setdiff(names(training), "Sale_Price")])
ytrain &lt;- training[["Sale_Price"]]
```

With our objects created, the syntax to fit a `lightgbm` model is then:


```r
first_lgb &lt;- lightgbm(
  data = xtrain,
  label = ytrain,
  verbose = -1L,
  obj = "regression",
)
```

In addition to providing our predictors and outcome, we also need to specify
that we want to do regression via `obj = "regression"`. 

I also like `lightgbm`
to run in quiet mode, so I set the argument `verbose = -1L`, but this is optional.

---

In order to predict with this model, we also need to convert our test set into
a matrix:


```r
xtest &lt;- as.matrix(testing[setdiff(names(testing), "Sale_Price")])
```

We can then use `predict` as normal to generate predictions:


```r
lgb_predictions &lt;- predict(first_lgb, xtest)
```

Then we calculate RMSE as normal:


```r
sqrt(mean((lgb_predictions - testing$Sale_Price)^2))
```

```
## [1] 36751.29
```

And all in all, this seems like a lot of work for a really crappy model.

---

But of course, GBMs are very sensitive to their hyperparameter values, and we
haven't tuned this model at all yet.

We'll tune this `lightgbm` model in a pretty similar way as to the last two weeks. 

First, we'll tweak the `calc_rmse` function from week 7 so that it will create
a matrix to predict on:


```r
calc_rmse &lt;- function(model, data) {
  xtest &lt;- as.matrix(data[setdiff(names(data), "Sale_Price")])
  lgb_predictions &lt;- predict(model, xtest)
  sqrt(mean((lgb_predictions - data$Sale_Price)^2))
}
```

We'll also tweak our `k_fold_cv` function so that it works with `lightgbm`. 
This function is a bit longer than last time, so it's on the next slide all by
itself.

---


```r
k_fold_cv &lt;- function(data, k, nrounds = 10L, ...) {
  per_fold &lt;- floor(nrow(data) / k)
  fold_order &lt;- sample(seq_len(nrow(data)), 
                       size = per_fold * k)
  fold_rows &lt;- split(
    fold_order,
    rep(1:k, each = per_fold)
  )
  vapply(
    fold_rows,
    \(fold_idx) {
      fold_test &lt;- data[fold_idx, ]
      fold_train &lt;- data[-fold_idx, ]
      
      xtrain &lt;- as.matrix(fold_train[setdiff(names(fold_train), 
                                             "Sale_Price")])
      ytrain &lt;- fold_train[["Sale_Price"]]
      
      fold_lgb &lt;- lightgbm(
        data = xtrain,
        label = ytrain,
        verbose = -1L,
        obj = "regression",
        nrounds = nrounds,
        params = ...
      )
      calc_rmse(fold_lgb, fold_test)
    },
    numeric(1)
  ) |&gt; 
    mean()
}
```

---

With the prep work out of the way, we can get started tuning hyperparameters.
At its core, `lightgbm` is still a GBM, and so has the same basic 
hyperparameters as our `gbm` model did. 

For instance, we'll start off by using a learning rate of 0.1 and tuning how
many trees our models should use. In `lightgbm`, this is called `nrounds`.


```r
tuning_grid &lt;- expand.grid(
  learning_rate = 0.1,
  nrounds = c(10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000),
  rmse = NA
)

for (i in seq_len(nrow(tuning_grid))) {
  tuning_grid$rmse[i] &lt;- k_fold_cv(
    training, 
    k = 5,
    learning_rate = tuning_grid$learning_rate[i],
    nrounds = tuning_grid$nrounds[i]
    )
}

head(arrange(tuning_grid, rmse), 2)
```

```
##   learning_rate nrounds     rmse
## 1           0.1    1000 25680.25
## 2           0.1    1500 26150.08
```

---

We can keep going to tune the other parameters we used in `gbm`. 

The maximum depth of trees here is called `max_depth`, instead of 
`interaction.depth`, and the minimum number of observations per leaf is called
`min_data_in_bin` rather than `n.minobsinnode`, but mechanically these 
hyperparameters do the same thing here as they did back in `gbm`. 

Among the normal values we're going to try for `max_depth`, we're also going to
try the special value "-1". When `max_depth` is set to -1, each decision tree is
allowed to grow as deep as it wants, with no hard limit set by the algorithm.

---

Our grid to tune these variables looks like this:


```r
tuning_grid &lt;- expand.grid(
  learning_rate = 0.1,
  nrounds = 1000,
  max_depth = c(-1, 2, 8, 32, 63),
  min_data_in_bin = c(3, 8, 13, 18),
  rmse = NA
)

for (i in seq_len(nrow(tuning_grid))) {
  tuning_grid$rmse[i] &lt;- k_fold_cv(
    training, 
    k = 5,
    learning_rate = tuning_grid$learning_rate[i],
    nrounds = tuning_grid$nrounds[i],
    max_depth = tuning_grid$max_depth[i],
    min_data_in_bin = tuning_grid$min_data_in_bin[i]
    )
}

head(arrange(tuning_grid, rmse), 2)
```

```
##   learning_rate nrounds max_depth min_data_in_bin     rmse
## 1           0.1    1000         2              18 24328.38
## 2           0.1    1000         2              13 24338.81
```

---

With the basic GBM hyperparameters sorted out, we can now start tuning the 
stochastic hyperparameters that make lightgbm so interesting.

Specifically, there are three new hyperparameters worth playing with:

+ `bagging_fraction` represents what percent of observations should be sampled 
  for each tree, just like `sampling.fraction` back in `ranger`.
  
+ `bagging_freq` represents how often bootstrapping should be resampled. If you
  set it to 1, then each tree is fit to a different bootstrap sample; if you set
  it to 5, then the model will fit five trees to the same sample before 
  resampling. If you set it to 0, the model won't resample ever.
  
+ `feature_fraction` represents the percentage of variables that should be 
  available to each tree. For instance, if you set it to 0.8, each tree would 
  be fit using a random 80% of predictors.

We'll tune these parameters on the next slide.

---


```r
tuning_grid &lt;- expand.grid(
  learning_rate = 0.1,
  nrounds = 1000,
  max_depth = 2,
  min_data_in_bin = 18,
  bagging_freq = c(0, 1, 5, 10), 
  bagging_fraction = seq(0.3, 1.0, 0.1),
  feature_fraction = seq(0.3, 1.0, 0.1),
  rmse = NA
)

for (i in seq_len(nrow(tuning_grid))) {
  tuning_grid$rmse[i] &lt;- k_fold_cv(
    training, 
    k = 5,
    learning_rate = tuning_grid$learning_rate[i],
    nrounds = tuning_grid$nrounds[i],
    max_depth = tuning_grid$max_depth[i],
    min_data_in_bin = tuning_grid$min_data_in_bin[i],
    bagging_freq = tuning_grid$bagging_freq[i],
    bagging_fraction = tuning_grid$bagging_fraction[i],
    feature_fraction = tuning_grid$feature_fraction[i]
    )
}

head(arrange(tuning_grid, rmse), 2) |&gt; 
  select(bagging_freq, bagging_fraction, feature_fraction, rmse)
```

```
##   bagging_freq bagging_fraction feature_fraction     rmse
## 1            5              0.9              0.6 23053.00
## 2            0              0.4              0.8 23241.62
```

At this point, we've tuned our model using the most important hyperparameters.
These hyperparameters are the ones that are most likely to impact our model 
accuracy; 90%+ of the possible improvements to your model come from these seven
hyperparameters.

But they aren't the only hyperparameters available. In fact, there are 86
hyperparameters in total, many of which might give some slight improvement to 
your model.

Most of the time you won't need to worry about the other hyperparameters 
available. But if you're using `lightgbm` or `xgboost` 
professionally and need the best performance at all costs, I highly recommend 
[this website (link) on available parameters](https://sites.google.com/view/lauraepp/parameters). 

The
[`lightgbm` docs also have some pointers on hyperparameters which might help
improve speed, accuracy, or overfitting (link).](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Parameters-Tuning.html)

---

With all that said and our tuning complete, let's go ahead and evaluate our
final test set accuracy:


```r
xtrain &lt;- as.matrix(training[setdiff(names(training), "Sale_Price")])
ytrain &lt;- training[["Sale_Price"]]

final_lgb &lt;- lightgbm(
  data = xtrain,
  label = ytrain,
  verbose = -1L,
  obj = "regression",
  nrounds = 1000,
  params = list(
    learning_rate = 0.1,
    max_depth = 2,
    min_data_in_bin = 18,
    bagging_freq = 5,
    bagging_fraction = 0.9,
    feature_fraction = 0.6
  )
)

calc_rmse(final_lgb, testing)
```

```
## [1] 19730.79
```

This is roughly comparable to the base GBM, but ran a lot faster -- and with
further tuning, we could likely beat GBM altogether.

---

So we now have three pretty alright models -- from `ranger`, `gbm`, and 
`lightgbm` -- all doing a good job predicting sale price for the Ames data.
What do we do with them now?

A lot of times in research, we'd go on to rank our models (by RMSE, MAE, or god
forbid, p-values) and then only talk about our "best" model, with all our 
results and conclusions drawn from the top-ranked model.

This is weird. We went through all the trouble of fitting multiple models 
because we thought they were all plausible options for the best tool for the job;
suddenly having 100% confidence in a single model being the best based on its 
ranking against the test set places a _lot_ of faith in your test set being 
exactly representative of real-world data.

What if there was a way to benefit from the work we put into training _all_ 
our models?

---

Turns out, there is. We can combine the predictions of our models to better 
represent our confidence in _each_ model's predictive accuracy, and as a side
effect usually generate better predictions overall.

This method is called **stacking** (or sometimes stacked generalization, or 
sometimes "super learners"). 

Just like GBMs and random forests, stacking 
aggregates multiple models in order to improve predictive accuracy. 

However, 
unlike those methods, stacking tries to combine _strong learners_ 
(models which are pretty accurate on their own) rather than weak learner
decision trees.

---

We'll walk through a few examples of stacking. First things first, we need to 
recreate our `ranger` and `gbm` models:





```r
library(ranger)
final_ranger &lt;- ranger(
  Sale_Price ~ .,
  training,
  num.trees = 800,
  mtry = 20,
  min.node.size = 5,
  replace = FALSE,
  sample.fraction = 1
)
```


```r
library(gbm)
final_gbm &lt;- gbm(
  Sale_Price ~ .,
  data = training,
  n.trees = 6000,
  shrinkage = 0.01,
  interaction.depth = 5,
  n.minobsinnode = 5
)
```

```
## Distribution not specified, assuming gaussian ...
```

---

In order to combine the predictions from these models, we'll first need to go
ahead and make some predictions. I'll create a new testing data frame, just to
keep our original test set clean:


```r
stacked_test &lt;- testing
```

And now I'll add columns with predictions to the data frame:


```r
xtest &lt;- as.matrix(stacked_test[setdiff(names(stacked_test), 
                                        "Sale_Price")])

stacked_test$lgb &lt;- predict(final_lgb, xtest)
stacked_test$rf &lt;- predictions(predict(final_ranger, stacked_test))
stacked_test$gbm &lt;- predict(final_gbm, stacked_test)
```

```
## Using 6000 trees...
```

---

So now that we have our predictions, how can we combine them into a single 
stacked ensemble?

We have a few options. The easiest is to simply average the predictions together:


```r
stacked_test$avg &lt;- (stacked_test$lgb + 
                       stacked_test$rf + 
                       stacked_test$gbm) / 3
```

Conceptually, doing this is a way of saying "all of these models are equally 
likely to be the best one". 

Pragmatically, even this simple ensemble beats all our models on the test data:


```r
stacked_test |&gt; 
  summarise(
    across(c(lgb, rf, gbm, avg), 
           \(x) sqrt(mean((x - Sale_Price)^2)))
  )
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 4
##      lgb     rf    gbm    avg
##    &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 19731. 22583. 19277. 18990.
```

---

But realistically, we don't think that all our models are equally likely to be
the best. We already know that, for instance, this random forest is a bit worse
at prediction than the two GBMs.

Instead of the simple average, it often makes sense to use a weighted average,
weighting each model's contribution to the final prediction based on its 
accuracy against a validation set or from k-fold CV.

Let's try that now. We'll first have to calculate RMSE for each of our models
from 5-fold CV. This takes a lot of code, so the next few slides will walk 
through each of the pieces.

First off, we'll write a function to fit our ranger models and return RMSEs:


```r
fit_ranger &lt;- function(training, testing) {
  cv_model &lt;- ranger(
  Sale_Price ~ .,
  training,
  num.trees = 800,
  mtry = 20,
  min.node.size = 5,
  replace = FALSE,
  sample.fraction = 1
)
  preds &lt;- predictions(predict(cv_model, testing))
  sqrt(mean((preds - testing$Sale_Price)^2))
}
```

---

We'll do the same for GBM:


```r
fit_gbm &lt;- function(training, testing) {
  cv_model &lt;- gbm(
  Sale_Price ~ .,
  data = training,
  n.trees = 6000,
  shrinkage = 0.01,
  interaction.depth = 5,
  n.minobsinnode = 5
)
  preds &lt;- predict(cv_model, testing)
  sqrt(mean((preds - testing$Sale_Price)^2))
}
```

---

And lastly for `lightgbm`:


```r
fit_lgb &lt;- function(training, testing) {
  xtrain &lt;- as.matrix(training[setdiff(names(training), "Sale_Price")])
  ytrain &lt;- training[["Sale_Price"]]
  xtest &lt;- as.matrix(testing[setdiff(names(testing), "Sale_Price")])
  
  cv_model &lt;- lightgbm(
  data = xtrain,
  label = ytrain,
  verbose = -1L,
  obj = "regression",
  nrounds = 1000,
  params = list(
    learning_rate = 0.1,
    max_depth = 2,
    min_data_in_bin = 18,
    bagging_freq = 5,
    bagging_fraction = 0.9,
    feature_fraction = 0.6
  )
)
  preds &lt;- predict(cv_model, xtest)
  sqrt(mean((preds - testing$Sale_Price)^2))
}
```

---

We can then use those functions to estimate model accuracy against each of the
five folds:


```r
per_fold &lt;- floor(nrow(training) / 5)
fold_order &lt;- sample(seq_len(nrow(training)), 
                       size = per_fold * 5)
fold_rows &lt;- split(
  fold_order,
  rep(1:5, each = per_fold)
)

model_rmse &lt;- data.frame(
  rf = rep(NA, 5),
  gbm = rep(NA, 5),
  lgb = rep(NA, 5)
)

for (i in seq_along(fold_rows)) {
  fold_test &lt;- training[fold_rows[[i]], ]
  fold_train &lt;- training[-fold_rows[[i]], ]
  
  model_rmse$rf[i] &lt;- fit_ranger(fold_test, fold_train)
  model_rmse$gbm[i] &lt;- suppressWarnings(fit_gbm(fold_test, fold_train))
  model_rmse$lgb[i] &lt;- fit_lgb(fold_test, fold_train)
}
```

```
## Distribution not specified, assuming gaussian ...
## Distribution not specified, assuming gaussian ...
## Distribution not specified, assuming gaussian ...
## Distribution not specified, assuming gaussian ...
## Distribution not specified, assuming gaussian ...
```

---

We now have RMSE estimates for each iteration of each of our models:


```r
model_rmse
```

```
##         rf      gbm      lgb
## 1 34385.77 28824.92 29900.48
## 2 30172.44 28571.99 29284.42
## 3 33759.57 30432.66 31634.38
## 4 28883.56 26352.62 29794.65
## 5 30152.59 27581.81 28876.70
```

Let's get the mean RMSE for each of those:


```r
(model_rmse &lt;- apply(model_rmse, 2, mean))
```

```
##       rf      gbm      lgb 
## 31470.78 28352.80 29898.13
```


In order to convert these into weights, we first want to invert the RMSEs:


```r
inverse_rmse &lt;- (1 / model_rmse)
```

And then calculate weights based on the relative sizes of the RMSEs:


```r
(rmse_weights &lt;- inverse_rmse / sum(inverse_rmse))
```

```
##        rf       gbm       lgb 
## 0.3161984 0.3509710 0.3328306
```

---

The vector `rmse_weights` now represents the proportion that each model will 
contribute to our final prediction. Intuitively enough, GBM here has a somewhat 
larger weight and the random forest has had its weight reduced from the baseline 
1/3.

We can then use these weights to adjust our aggregated predictions:


```r
stacked_test$weighted &lt;- 
  stacked_test$lgb * rmse_weights[["lgb"]] + 
  stacked_test$rf * rmse_weights[["rf"]] + 
  stacked_test$gbm * rmse_weights[["gbm"]]

stacked_test |&gt; 
  summarise(
    across(c(lgb, rf, gbm, avg, weighted), 
           \(x) sqrt(mean((x - Sale_Price)^2)))
  )
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 5
##      lgb     rf    gbm    avg weighted
##    &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 19731. 22583. 19277. 18990.   18955.
```

And this method beats our simple average!

---

It's possible to stack models in even more complex ways than that. For instance,
what if rather than using the same weights to predict each observation, we used
a model to aggregate our model predictions?

To do that, we'd need to be able to observe our model predicting data it had 
never seen before. We can accomplish this by breaking off a piece of our 
training set to use as a validation set instead:


```r
training &lt;- ames[row_idx &lt; nrow(ames) * 0.6, ]
validation &lt;- ames[row_idx &gt;= nrow(ames) * 0.6 &amp; 
                     row_idx &lt; nrow(ames) * 0.8, ]
```

---

Once that's accomplished, we need to fit new models on the smaller training 
data, starting with the random forest and GBM:


```r
validation_rf &lt;- ranger(
  Sale_Price ~ .,
  training,
  num.trees = 800,
  mtry = 20,
  min.node.size = 5,
  replace = FALSE,
  sample.fraction = 1
)
validation_gbm &lt;- gbm(
  Sale_Price ~ .,
  data = training,
  n.trees = 6000,
  shrinkage = 0.01,
  interaction.depth = 7,
  n.minobsinnode = 10
)
```

```
## Distribution not specified, assuming gaussian ...
```

---

Then continuing with `lightgbm`:


```r
xtrain &lt;- as.matrix(training[setdiff(names(training), "Sale_Price")])
ytrain &lt;- training[["Sale_Price"]]

validation_lgb &lt;- lightgbm(
  data = xtrain,
  label = ytrain,
  verbose = -1L,
  obj = "regression",
  nrounds = 1000,
  params = list(
    learning_rate = 0.1,
    max_depth = 2,
    min_data_in_bin = 18,
    bagging_freq = 5,
    bagging_fraction = 0.9,
    feature_fraction = 0.6
  )
)
```

---

With our models fit, we can now use them to predict the validation data:


```r
xtest &lt;- as.matrix(validation[setdiff(names(validation), "Sale_Price")])

validation$rf &lt;- predictions(predict(validation_rf, validation))
validation$gbm &lt;- predict(validation_gbm, validation)
```

```
## Using 6000 trees...
```

```r
validation$lgb &lt;- predict(validation_lgb, xtest)
```

And then fit some model to predict sale price based on our predictions. 

Here I'm going to use a simple linear model as an ensemble, but we could use
anything -- including random forests or GBMs -- to aggregate our predictions:


```r
ensemble_model &lt;- lm(Sale_Price ~ rf * gbm * lgb, data = validation)
```

---

All that's left is to generate predictions from this ensemble model:


```r
stacked_test$model_weight &lt;- predict(ensemble_model, stacked_test)

stacked_test |&gt; 
  summarise(
    across(c(lgb, rf, gbm, avg, weighted, model_weight), 
           \(x) sqrt(mean((x - Sale_Price)^2)))
  )
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 6
##      lgb     rf    gbm    avg weighted model_weight
##    &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 19731. 22583. 19277. 18990.   18955.       19171.
```

While this model doesn't outperform our simple averages, we might try using more
complex models to see if we could eke out any further improvements in RMSE. 
Or, of course, we could decide that our simple averages are good enough for 
the purposes of our model; it all depends on your application.

Stacked ensembles are incredibly useful ways to reflect uncertainty about which
of your models is the "best", and can often give you increased predictive 
accuracy as well. 

---

Even when they aren't your outright best model, stacked ensembles are a useful way to 
make your predictions more robust on unknown data. 

It might be the case that a given model is always the best option in the 
situations we'll use it in, or it might be the case that with different test 
data a different model would take the lead.

We can't know for certain, and stacking is a good way to reflect and protect
against that uncertainty.

---

You can also extend stacking to some pretty silly places, if you want to.

For instance, we create a whole bunch of models while doing grid searches, 
because we think they might be the best version of that model for our data.

What if, instead of selecting the best set of hyperparameters, we ensembled
all of the models in the grid instead?

Depending on your models, this might actually give you huge gains in accuracy.
But at some point, the accuracy gains from stacking are outweighed by the time 
and computational power it requires. Of course, where exactly that point is 
will be different for every project.

That's all for this week. Next week we move away from tree-based models onto 
our last class of ML algorithms.
