A lot of the stuff going on [in AI] is not very ambitious. In machine learning, one of the big steps that happened in the mid-’80s was to say, “Look, here’s some real data – can I get my program to predict accurately on parts of the data that I haven’t yet provided to it?” What you see now in machine learning is that people see that as the only task.

Last week, we talked about how decision trees tend to overfit, producing high
variance models which might change a lot if they were fit to a different 
training set. 

If we could find a way to reduce that variance, we might be able to make our
model altogether more accurate. If our prediction surface had softer
edges, we might be able to capture more of the actual structure of our data.

And so statisticians had an idea: what if we fit decision trees to _many_ training
sets, then aggregate the predictions? 

Each individual decision tree will still be high-variance, but maybe the
average of their predictions could smooth out some of the hard thresholds.

---
class: middle

The first problem with this plan, of course, is that now we need more than one 
training set. 

We could split our original training set into smaller pieces, and fit separate
models to each of those. 

However, decision trees perform better on relatively
large data sets, meaning we want to be careful about breaking our training
data into too many pieces. 

Instead, if we want to fit decision trees to many training sets, it's usually
better to resample our data to create those sets.

---
class: middle

Usually, we'll resample our training data to create new training sets of the
same size (the same number of observations/rows) as the original training data.

When we do this _with replacement_ (so that each observation can be sampled more
than once), we call it **bootstrapping**, and each subsample a 
**bootstrap sample**.

&lt;br /&gt;

---
class: middle

Let's go ahead and make some bootstrap samples for our Ames housing data.

First off, let's make the Ames data frame and split it into training and testing
sets:


```r
set.seed(123)

ames &lt;- AmesHousing::make_ames()
row_idx &lt;- sample(seq_len(nrow(ames)), nrow(ames))
training &lt;- ames[row_idx &lt; nrow(ames) * 0.8, ]
testing &lt;- ames[row_idx &gt;= nrow(ames) * 0.8, ]
```


We can then use the `sample` function to create a bootstrap sample from our 
training data like so:


```r
single_bootstrap &lt;- training[sample(1:nrow(training), 
                                    size = nrow(training), 
                                    replace = TRUE), ]
```

---
class: middle

But we don't want _one_ bootstrap sample, we want _many_.

Let's go ahead and use `lapply` to run our bootstrapping code 100 times (chosen
because it's a nice round number).

We'll store the output as a list named `ames_bootstraps`:


```r
ames_bootstraps &lt;- lapply(
  1:100,
  \(x) training[sample(1:nrow(training), 
                       size = nrow(training), 
                       replace = TRUE), ]
)
```

Note that `lapply` is running our code once for each value from 1 to 100, but
we aren't using that value anywhere -- our resampling code takes no input 
arguments.

---
class: middle

So now we have our 100 separate bootstraps of our training data. 

We can use
`lapply` again to fit a separate decision tree to each of those samples:




```r
library(rpart)
ames_trees &lt;- lapply(
  ames_bootstraps,
  \(x) rpart(Sale_Price ~ ., x)
)
```

&lt;br /&gt;

This time around we're actually using that "x" as an input value to pass 
different training data to each function.

---

And just like that, we have 100 decision trees! If we wanted, we could use 
`rpart.plot` to visualize each of our trees. Doing so, we'd quickly notice that 
each tree uses different variables, has a different number of leaf nodes, and 
otherwise produces different predictions -- all because they're each fit to a 
different data set.


```r
rpart.plot::rpart.plot(ames_trees[[1]])
```

&lt;img src="week_6_imgs/first_tree.jpeg" width="1783" /&gt;

---
class: middle

We now have our 100 decision trees, and need to use them to make predictions.

We can use a short loop to create 100 new columns in our testing data frame, 
each with the predictions from a different tree:


```r
tree_testing &lt;- testing
for (i in seq_along(ames_trees)) {
  tree_testing[[paste0("tree_", i)]] &lt;- predict(
    ames_trees[[i]],
    testing
  )
}
```

&lt;br /&gt;

But at the end of the day, 100 different predictions isn't super useful to us. 
We need to combine these into a single prediction if we're going to use this 
model to make decisions or inform our actions.

A surprisingly effective way to aggregate our 100 predictions into a final value 
is to simply take the mean of the individual tree predictions, 
which we can do with `rowMeans`:


```r
library(dplyr)
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'dplyr'
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
## 
##     filter, lag
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
## 
##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
```

```r
tree_testing &lt;- tree_testing |&gt; 
  mutate(tree_aggregate = rowMeans(across(starts_with("tree_"))))
```

---
class: middle

Let's go ahead and boil those predictions down into RMSEs. 

First, we'll use the
`summarize` function to calculate the RMSE of each decision tree's predictions
(the columns that "start with" `tree_`):


```r
tree_rmse &lt;- tree_testing |&gt; 
  summarize(
    across(
      starts_with("tree_"),
      ~ sqrt(mean((.x - tree_testing$Sale_Price)^2))
           )
  )
```

&lt;br /&gt;

Then we'll use the `pivot_longer` function to take our super-wide table and make
it "long", so our RMSE values are stored in a single column. We'll also sort the
table by RMSE so that our most-successful models are on top:


```r
library(tidyr)
tree_rmse &lt;- tree_rmse |&gt; 
  pivot_longer(everything(), values_to = "RMSE") |&gt; 
  arrange(RMSE)
```

(If you haven't seen `pivot_longer` before, I recommend section 12.3 of
[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html#pivoting)).

---
class: middle

And finally, let's look at the first few rows of RMSE:


```r
head(tree_rmse)
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 × 2
##   name             RMSE
##   &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 tree_aggregate 35252.
## 2 tree_10        36457.
## 3 tree_29        36886.
## 4 tree_81        36955.
## 5 tree_70        37305.
## 6 tree_84        37430.
```

&lt;br /&gt;

Our aggregated model (the mean of all other tree predictions) is dramatically 
better than the component trees, with an RMSE that's over $1,000 lower.

---
class: middle

This method that we just walked through is called **bootstrap aggregation**,
or **bagging** for short. 

It can be done with any model, not just decision trees, and works just as well 
for classification as regression
(though classifiers often aggregate using the _most common_ predicted class 
instead of the mean predicted probability).

At its core, bagging improves predictions by reducing the variance of the model,
just as we discussed last week. Look for instance at this graph of the 
predictions of our bagged model (red points) compared to the component models 
(blue): 

&lt;br /&gt;

![](week_6_slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

Our aggregated model has much less "spread" in its predictions than the decision 
trees, with similar sale prices getting generally similar predictions.

---
class: middle

It's worth comparing the results from our bagged model to what we'd get from 
just a single decision tree:


```r
single_tree &lt;- rpart(Sale_Price ~ ., training)
sqrt(mean((predict(single_tree, training) - training$Sale_Price)^2))
```

```
## [1] 38055.45
```


```r
head(tree_rmse, 1)
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 2
##   name             RMSE
##   &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 tree_aggregate 35252.
```

So our aggregated model is a pretty large improvement over the single decision
tree approach. 

---
class: middle

And it's worth noting that this improvement isn't just because our component 
trees happened to be better fits.

&lt;br /&gt;

In fact, a lot of the individual trees are actually _worse_ predictors than our 
non-aggregated tree:


```r
tail(tree_rmse)
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 × 2
##   name      RMSE
##   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 tree_9  43322.
## 2 tree_74 43334.
## 3 tree_93 43631.
## 4 tree_1  43917.
## 5 tree_56 46506.
## 6 tree_25 47496.
```

&lt;br /&gt;

We call these individual decision trees, which aren't much better than randomly 
guessing sale prices, **weak learners**.

---
class: middle

The theory here is similar to the idea that if you have a bunch of people guess
how many jelly beans are in a jar, the average of everyone's guesses is probably
going to be a lot closer than any individual guess. 

&lt;br /&gt;

In this sort of situation, having higher variance in your guesses is helpful to 
improve predictions. 

&lt;br /&gt;

You don't necessarily need any given person person to be 
an incredible guesser, but you're hoping that someone else in the crowd is 
guessing equally badly in the opposite direction so that all the predictions 
average out to the "truth". 

&lt;br /&gt;

You can improve your predictive accuracy just by combining weak learners.

---

Which begs the question: can we add even _more_ variance to our component trees?

Right now we have 100 decision trees, each fit using different training data and 
the same predictors. What if we started using different _predictors_ for each,
as well? What if, for instance, we fit each tree on a different random 40%
of predictors?

Let's try it and find out! First, we'll get a vector of all our predictors:


```r
ames_names &lt;- setdiff(names(ames), "Sale_Price")
```

And then we can fit our trees using almost exactly the same code as we used for 
bagging. The only difference is that we'll subset our training data to use a 
random 40% of variables each time:


```r
random_variable_trees &lt;- lapply(
  ames_bootstraps,
  \(x) {
    # Select a random 40% of variables (and Sale_Price)
    x &lt;- x[
      c(sample(ames_names, size = length(ames_names) * 0.4), 
        "Sale_Price")
      ]
    rpart(Sale_Price ~ ., x)
  }
)
```

(40%, just like 100 trees earlier, is just a round number I chose at random.)

---

We can use almost exactly the same code as earlier to find our RMSE:


```r
tree_testing &lt;- testing
for (i in seq_along(random_variable_trees)) {
  tree_testing[[paste0("tree_", i)]] &lt;- predict(
    random_variable_trees[[i]],
    testing
  )
}

tree_testing &lt;- tree_testing |&gt; 
  mutate(tree_aggregate = rowMeans(across(starts_with("tree_"))))

tree_rmse &lt;- tree_testing |&gt; 
  summarize(
    across(
      starts_with("tree_"),
      ~ sqrt(mean((.x - tree_testing$Sale_Price)^2))
           )
  )

tree_rmse &lt;- tree_rmse |&gt; 
  pivot_longer(everything(), values_to = "RMSE") |&gt; 
  arrange(RMSE)
```

---
class: middle


```r
head(tree_rmse, 3)
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 × 2
##   name             RMSE
##   &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 tree_aggregate 30999.
## 2 tree_67        36065.
## 3 tree_41        37721.
```

&lt;br /&gt;

So we've _dramatically_ improved on our bagged model, just by fitting each tree
to a different random subset of our predictors. 

Increasing the variance of our trees results in better aggregated predictions,
even as the individual trees become worse.

---
class: middle

But can we go further? 

What if instead of fitting each _tree_ to a different set of variables, we chose
a random group of variables for each _split_? 

This way each tree could still 
potentially include every variable, but we'd force the trees to vary by 
restricting their choices when splitting.

This technique is what we call the **random forest** algorithm. Originally introduced in a
seminal 2001 paper by Leo Breiman ([link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1010933404324)),
the random forest is one of the first true machine learning methods and is still
in common use today.

Rather than find a way to select random variables at each split, 
we're going to use the `ranger` package to make random forests in this course.

Go ahead and install it now, then load it:


```r
install.packages("ranger")
library(ranger)
```



---
class: middle

We can then use the `ranger` function to fit our random forests, using the 
same syntax as with `lm`:


```r
ames_rf &lt;- ranger(Sale_Price ~ ., training)
```

That `ranger` call will create 500 decision trees, fit to bootstrap 
samples, using random variable subsets for each split, incredibly quickly.

We can then use `predict` to get our predictions for the test set -- but note 
that we need to wrap this function in the `predictions` function from `ranger`
to get actual numeric predictions:


```r
rf_predictions &lt;- predictions(predict(ames_rf, testing))
```

We can then use those to calculate RMSE:


```r
sqrt(mean((rf_predictions - tree_testing$Sale_Price)^2))
```

```
## [1] 23143.89
```

Immediately, out-of-the-box, the random forest _dramatically_ out-performs our
best bagged tree model, to say nothing of our simple decision trees and linear
regressions we've used in the past.

---

But just like with decision trees, random forests have **hyperparameters** --
values which can be very important in influencing our predictions but can't be 
automatically determined when fitting your model to the training data.

For instance, we can use the `min.node.size` hyperparameter to control how
deep we want each of our trees to grow. Just like the `minbucket` argument to 
`rpart`, this value sets how many observations each leaf node needs to have, 
controlling how deep our trees can get.

For instance, we might notice an improvement in accuracy if we set our min node
size to 1, letting each decision tree grow as deep as needed to classify
every observation:


```r
min_node &lt;- ranger(Sale_Price ~ ., 
                     training, 
                     min.node.size = 1)

rf_predictions &lt;- predictions(predict(min_node, testing))
sqrt(mean((rf_predictions - tree_testing$Sale_Price)^2))
```

```
## [1] 22735.54
```


---

There are a few other hyperparameters which can have sizable impacts on our 
random forests, namely:

+ `mtry`: How many variables should be considered at each split?
+ `num.trees`: How many decision trees should be aggregated?
+ `sample.fraction`: What percent of observations should be sampled for each 
tree? If set to 1 and `replace` is set to TRUE, the random forest will use 
bagged trees like we walked through earlier, but it's often a good idea to mess
with the sampling.
+ `replace`: Sample observations with replacement? 

Choosing smart values for these hyperparameters can give us pretty notable 
improvements over the default model:


```r
new_params &lt;- ranger(Sale_Price ~ ., 
                     training, 
                     num.trees = 800, 
                     mtry = 20, 
                     min.node.size = 1, 
                     replace = FALSE, 
                     sample.fraction = 1)

rf_predictions &lt;- predictions(predict(new_params, testing))
sqrt(mean((rf_predictions - tree_testing$Sale_Price)^2))
```

```
## [1] 21467.52
```

---

So... how do we pick smart values for hyperparameters?

Short answer: trial and error.

For the long answer: We'll pick that up next week.

---

One last note for this week. While we've focused entirely on regression today, 
all of the techniques we've gone over can be easily applied to classification
problems as well. To aggregate our trees, we can either average our class 
probabilities across each tree, or just take the most common class predicted by
the individual trees.

As a quick example, let's load in our `attrition` data and make train/test 
splits:


```r
library(modeldata)
data(attrition)
row_idx &lt;- sample(seq_len(nrow(attrition)), nrow(attrition))
training &lt;- attrition[row_idx &lt; nrow(attrition) * 0.8, ]
testing &lt;- attrition[row_idx &gt;= nrow(attrition) * 0.8, ]
```

To fit a random forest classifier, we can use exactly the same syntax as with
regression:


```r
rf_classifier &lt;- ranger(Attrition ~ ., data = training)
```

Everything we've talked about with classification in the past -- sensitivity and
specificity, dealing with imbalanced classes, and so on -- still applies when
dealing with random forests. 

I've included the confusion matrix for this classifier on the next page, so 
we can see fit statistics for this model. Note in particular how non-sensitive
our model is -- it does a _really_ bad job at predicting people who _do_ quit.
We'd need to either weight our classes, balance our data, or set a different
threshold for this model.
