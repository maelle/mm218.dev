# Course Structure

Each week there will be a handout to read before class. You are encouraged to 
type the code from the handouts into your own R session, in order to develop
familiarity with the syntax and develop muscle memory for common tasks.

Class time on Wednesday will be a discussion format, dedicated to answering any
questions from the reading. Office hours will be available weekly to help debug
code problems or answer more specific questions.

# Final Project

The primary assignment for this class is a single project where you'll apply
the techniques from this course to a data set of your choosing. 

The last week of the semester you'll hand in two files -- one containing the
code used in the course of your project, the other a short report about the 
question you set out to answer, the methods you used, your results, and some
reflection on what went well and what you'd change to make your models better.
You'll also give a five-minute presentation on your project during the final 
class session. 

A rubric for this project will be made available during the semester.
